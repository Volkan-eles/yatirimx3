      "description": "In 1953, an understanding that would pioneer a country's urbanization efforts and raise people's quality of life came to life. The successful journey of Emlak Konut, a long-established brand in the construction sector, began. Establishing environmentally friendly, modern cities that would add comfort to human life was determined as the corporate vision. With this basic purpose, Emlak Konut became the architect of many innovative applications in its sector. Emlak Konut carried out projects that set an example and left a mark in the planned urbanization of our country. It built the most innovative cities of its time, large enough to give its name to the district it was located in. This stable growth brought with it a serious turning point and in 2002, Emlak Konut became a real estate investment partnership. This transformation was actually the harbinger of giant projects, groundbreaking initiatives and becoming a bigger company. With becoming a \"Real Estate Investment Partnership\", Emlak Konut was behind projects that resonated around the world in the field of design, included environmentally friendly technologies and added value to the city. Since 2003, it has tendered a total of 388 projects of various sizes, and as a result of the completion of these projects, it will have ensured the construction of 251,000 independent units. Emlak Konut went public twice with a breakthrough that would crown its rapid growth and carry its goals to broader horizons. The first offering in 2010 became one of the 5 largest public offerings in the history of the Republic. The secondary offering in 2013 was the largest public offering in the real estate sector in Europe in the last 5 years. Growing with the public offerings, Emlak Konut has further consolidated its place among the strongest companies in Turkey with its paid-in capital of 3.8 billion liras and total assets of 205 billion liras as of the end of 2024.",

      "description": "Akfen Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Akfen GYO\") was formed through the rebranding, transformation, and restructuring of Aksel Tourism Investments and Management Inc. (\"Aksel\") into a real estate investment trust. Aksel was initially established on June 25, 1997, as a partnership between Hamdi Akin and Yüksel Construction Inc. to invest in the domestic tourism sector. Subsequently, Yüksel Construction Inc.'s shares were acquired by Akfen Holding Inc. (\"Akfen Holding\") in 2006, and the Company became a subsidiary of Akfen Holding. The restructuring was finalized with the Company's conversion into a \"Real Estate Investment Trust\" on August 25, 2006, by the Capital Markets Board (\"CMB\"), with its decision numbered 31/894, dated July 14, 2006, following the Board of Directors' decision dated April 25, 2006. The adoption of the Real Estate Investment Trust title and the change in its field of activity were published in the Trade Registry Gazette on August 31, 2006. On August 6, 2018, 1,000 Group A and 1,000 Group D preferred shares of Akfen GYO owned by Akfen Holding were transferred to Hamdi Akin, who is the indirect ultimate owner of the management control of these shares. The Company's main field of activity is to invest in real estate-based capital market instruments, to create and develop a real estate portfolio, and to engage in the written objectives and subjects described in Articles 5, 23, and 25 of the CMB's Communiqué on Principles Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts (Series III, No: 48.1). In 2005, the Company signed a framework agreement with ACCOR SA, one of the world's leading hotel chains, to develop hotel projects in Türkiye under the Novotel and Ibis Hotel brands. The Company primarily develops hotel projects under the Novotel and Ibis Hotel brands and operates under the auspices of Tamaris Turizm A.S., a 100% subsidiary of ACCOR SA in Türkiye. (Tamaris). The Company was listed on Borsa Istanbul (BIST) on 11 May 2011.",
